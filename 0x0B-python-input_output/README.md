*0x0B. Python - Input/Output*


Python provides several ways to present the output of a program, including printing data in a human-readable form or writing it to a file for future use. The print() function is used to display output to the console, and the input() function is used to take input from the user.

To read a text file in Python, we can use the built-in open() function with the with statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading. We can define a function read_file() that takes a filename as an argument and reads the contents of the file using the read() method of the file object. We can then print the contents of the file to stdout using the print() function.

Python also provides ways to format output to make it more readable and attractive. The str.format() method can be used to format output by using placeholders and specifying the order in which they are printed.

To create a class that inherits from another class, we can define a new class that inherits from the parent class and implements its own methods and attributes. For example, to create a Rectangle class that inherits from a BaseGeometry class, we can define a Rectangle class that inherits from BaseGeometry and implements its own __init__ method to set private attributes for width and height. We can also implement the area() method to calculate the area of the rectangle and the __str__() method to return a string representation of the rectangle.
