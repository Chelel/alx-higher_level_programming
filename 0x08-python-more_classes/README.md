0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

. A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state

Everything is an object, including integers, strings, lists, functions, and even classes themselves. However, Python hides the object machinery with the help of special syntax. For example, when you type num = 42, Python actually creates a new object of type integer with the value 42, and assigns its reference to the name num
