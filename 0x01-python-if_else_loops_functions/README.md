0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

CONTROL FLOW
A program's control flow is the order in which the program's code executes.
The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.
Python has three types of control structures: Sequential - default mode. Selection - used for decisions and branching.

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
