Python - import & modules.

What is a Module?
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py
The module can then be used by using the import statement.

EXAMPLE.
I have a module (file) saved myModule.py
to use the module, I'll import it and call the function within it.

import myModule

myModule.greet('Jenna')
